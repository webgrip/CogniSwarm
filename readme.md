### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/puttygpt.git
cd puttygpt
```

(Put this in init.sh later or makefile) Build and run the Docker containers using the provided docker-compose files

```
# Prerequisite (I can probably get rid of this but meh not right now)
docker network create weaviate-network

# Without public grpc endpoint
docker-compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml -f docker-compose.yml up --build

# With grpc endpoint (run this after previous)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.brazen.yml up brazen --build

# Copy env file
cp .env.example .env

# replace the string for searxng
sed -i "s|ReplaceWithARealKey\!|$(openssl rand -base64 33)|g" .env
```

Cleanup:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.brazen.yml down --remove-orphan
```
