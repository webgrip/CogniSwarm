=========================================

# 🚧 Before you proceed 🚧
Please note that this is a very early version of the project, and we are still in the process of wrapping things up, wiring components together, and experimenting with new ideas. As such, the project may undergo significant changes and updates as we continue to evolve and refine our vision. Any ideas are welcome and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

- Supports a range of AI tools, including summarization, sentiment analysis, and OpenAPI integration
- Customizable prompt templates for diverse use cases
- Efficient concurrent task execution using asyncio and aiohttp
- Detailed tracing and callback mechanisms for monitoring and debugging
- Designed for extensibility and easy integration with other APIs and services
- Dockerized deployment for ease of installation and scalability



:rocket: Getting Started
------------------------

### Docker Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/webgrip/CogniSwarm.git
cd CogniSwarm
cp .env.example .env
sed -i "s|ReplaceWithARealKey\!|$(openssl rand -base64 33)|g" .env
# Now change your .env values #

```
(Put this in init.sh later or makefile)
Build and run the Docker containers using the provided docker-compose files:

```
# Prerequisite (I can probably get rid of this but meh not right now)
docker network create weaviate-network

# Without public grpc endpoint
docker-compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml -f docker-compose.yml up --build

# With grpc endpoint (run this after previous)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.brazen.yml up brazen --build



# replace the string for searxng


```

Cleanup:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.brazen.yml down --remove-orphans
```


### Usage

To interact with the application, monitor your docker logs for `eve`
